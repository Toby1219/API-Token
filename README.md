# API-Token

This repository provides a framework for working with API tokens securely and efficiently. It is designed to simplify the process of managing tokens for authentication and authorization in web applications.

## Features

- **Token Management**: Generate, validate, and manage API tokens.
- **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes secure methods to authenticate users and services.
- **Integration Ready**: Easily integrates with existing Python web applications.
- **Customization**: Configurable settings to tailor token expiration, revocation, and security.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Toby1219/API-Token.git
   cd API-Token
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store sensitive configuration details. Below is an example of what the `.env` file might include:

```plaintext
SECRETE_KEY=your_secret_key  # Used for Flask session signing
JWT_SECRETE_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key  # Used for signing JWT tokens
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url  # Provide the database connection string
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATION=False  # Disable SQLAlchemy's event system
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

2. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

- **Token Generation**: Generate API tokens for secure communication.
- **Token Validation**: Validate incoming tokens to ensure proper access control.
- **Token Revocation**: Revoke tokens when no longer required.
